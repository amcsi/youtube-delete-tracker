# youtube-delete-tracker

Doesn't it suck when you have your Youtube playlists with your favorite music, movie scenes, whatever gets deleted, and you would want to find a replacement, but Youtube doesn't tell you the titles of the videos that had been removed, so you don't remember which were the videos you needed to replace?

Well that's where this project comes in. Enter your Youtube channel identifier, and have all the videos in all of your playlists scanned for titles every day. Then when it comes to any of the videos being deleted, you can find out what the title of the video was with the help of this project.

(Note that it's not possible to retroactively recover the titles before getting your playlists scanned.)
